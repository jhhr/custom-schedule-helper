# Custom Schedule Helper

Custom Schedule Helper is an Anki add-on duplicating all the functionalites of the F4SRSAnki Helper
but instead a different custom scheduling setup. It has the same six main features + one extra

- **Reschedule** cards based on their previous review.
- **Postpone** a selected number of due cards.
- **Advance** a selected number of undue cards.
- **Balance** the load during rescheduling (based on fuzz).
- **No Anki** on Free Days (such as weekends) during rescheduling (based on load balance).
- **Disperse** Siblings (cards with the same note) to avoid interference & reminder.
- **Auto Ease Factor** changes the ease factor based on reviews very gently. Uses entire review history.



# Installation

Just install the addon and use my scheduler.
Or...

1. Write your own custom scheduling js code and apply it. Mine is included in this repository in `custom_scheduler.js`
2. Edit this addon and duplicate that functionality in the `Scheduler.next_interval` function in `schedule/reschule.py`
3. Also edit the Auto Ease Factor logic in `ease/ease_calculator.py` if you don't like the
   aggressively attenuated ease changes.

# Usage

## Overview

| Feature name      | How does it work?                                            | When should I use it?                                        |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Reschedule        | Changes the due dates of cards using the scheduling logic. | When you update you scheduling logic and want to retroactively change the upcoming reviews. |
| Advance           | Decreases the intervals of undue cards based on elapsed time since last review and interval length to (maybe) minimize damage to long-term learning. | When you want to review your material ahead of time, for example, before a test. |
| Postpone          | Increases the intervals of cards that are due today based on elapsed time since last review and interval length in a way that (maybe) minimizes damage to long-term learning. | When you are dealing with a large number of reviews after taking a break from Anki or after rescheduling. |
| Load Balancing    | After the optimal interval is calculated, it is adjusted by a random amount to make the distribution of reviews over time more uniform. | Always. This feature makes your workload (reviews per day) more consistent. |
| Free Days         | After the optimal interval is calculated, it is slightly adjusted to change the due date. | If you don't want to study on some days of the week, for example, Sundays. |
| Disperse Siblings | Siblings are cards generated from the same note. Their intervals are adjusted to spread them further apart from each other. | Always. This feature alleviates the interference; disabling it will only decrease the efficiency of spaced repetition. |

## Reschedule

Rescheduling can calculate the memory states and intervals based on each card's review history and the parameters from the Scheduler code. These parameters can be personalized with the FSRS Optimizer.

**Note**: For cards that have been reviewed multiple times using Anki's default algorithm, rescheduling may give different intervals than the Scheduler because the Scheduler can't access the full review history when running. In this case, the intervals given by rescheduling will be more accurate. But after rescheduling once, there will be no difference between the two.

## Advance/Postpone

These two functions are very similar, so I'll talk about them together. You can set the number of cards to advance/postpone, and the Helper add-on will sort your cards and perform the advance/postpone in such a way that the deviation from the original review schedule is minimal while meeting the number of cards you set.

## Load Balance

Once the load balance option is enabled, rescheduling will make the daily review load as consistent and smooth as possible.

Here's a comparison, the first graph is rescheduling before enabling it, and the second graph is after enabling:

## Free days

You can choose any day or days from Monday to Sunday to take off. Once enabled, the Helper will try
to avoid these days when rescheduling. Note: Free days only works for review cards. Due to technical
limitations, Custom Schedule doesn't modify the interval and due date of (re)learning cards. And it also
doesn't reschedule cards whose interval is less than 3 days to respect the desired retention (maybe).

**Effect**:

## Disperse Siblings

In Anki, some templates will generate multiple cards related in content from the same note, such as reversed cards (Front->Back, Back->Front) and cloze cards (when you make multiple clozes on the same note). If the review dates of these cards are too close, they may interfere with or remind you of each other. Dispersing siblings can spread the review dates of these cards out as much as possible.

## Other features
- **Auto reschedule cards reviewed on other devices after sync:** This option is useful if you do some (or all) of your reviews on platforms that don't support FSRS such as AnkiDroid or AnkiWeb. If this option is enabled, the reviews synced from the other devices will be automatically rescheduled according to the FSRS algorithm. If you are relying on this feature, it is recommended to sync the reviews daily for the best results.
- **Auto reschedule the card you just reviewed (<=2.1.66):** If you enable this option, every card that you review will be rescheduled. Enabling this option is not essential for using Custom Schedule. It is mainly intended for gradually transitioning your old cards to FSRS when starting to use Custom Schedule. The other option for transitioning old cards to FSRS is to reschedule all cards, but this tends to induce a huge backlog for many people. Other advantages of enabling the "Auto reschedule the card you just reviewed" option include:
    - Load balance and free days are applied when rescheduling.
    - It allows you to use learning or relearning steps longer than or equal to 1 day without breaking the scheduling. However, for best results, it is not recommended to use such steps even with this option enabled because Custom Schedule can determine the next intervals more accurately.

    However, this option also has some disadvantages, which include:
    - The intervals displayed above the answer buttons may be inconsistent with the real interval after rescheduling, though the real ones will be more optimal.
    - It might have a small effect on the responsiveness of Anki and introduce lags because it needs more calculations for each review and causes constant queue rebuilding.
    - If it is enabled, after answering a card, it requires two undo key presses to actually undo answering the card.
- **Auto disperse siblings:** It automatically disperses siblings after each review and after sync (if auto-reschedule after sync is enabled).
- **Reschedule all cards:** This option is used to reschedule all the cards in the decks in which Custom Schedule is enabled. It should only be used after you have installed Custom Schedule for the first time and/or updated your parameters.
- **Reschedule cards reviewed in the last 7 days:** This option can be used to reschedule the cards that were reviewed in the last few days. The number of days can be adjusted in the add-on config.
